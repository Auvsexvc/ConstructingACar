    /// You have to construct a car. Step by Step.
    /// First you have to implement the engine and the fuel tank.
    /// The default fuel level of a car is 20 liters.
    /// The maximum size of the tank is 60 liters.
    /// Of course every car's life begins with an engine not running. ;-)
    /// Every call of a method from the car correlates to 1 second.
    /// The fuel consumption in running idle is 0.0003 liter/second.
    /// For convenience the start of the engine consumes nothing and we don't care, if the engine is warm or cold.
    /// The fuel tank is on reserve, if the level is under 5 liters.
    /// The fuel tank display shows the level as rounded for 2 decimal places.
    /// Internally an accuracy up to 10 decimal places should be more than enough.
    /// In difference to most real cars, the fuel tank display is always showing its information, also when the the engine is not running.
    /// And consider the locigal things about fuel and engine... ;-)
    /// In all tests only the whole car will be tested. Feel free to write your own tests for the other classes.
    /// As second step you have to implement the logic for driving, which includes accelerating, braking and free-wheeling.
    /// If the car is free-wheeling (no pedal is used), it slows down the car by 1 km/h by air resistance and rolling resistance.
    /// Braking is BY a speed. Accelerating is TO a speed. (Remember: Every call of a method from the car correlates to 1 second.)
    /// For every car the default acceleration is at most 10 km/h per second.
    /// In a new further constructor of the car it should be possible to set a higher acceleration. The value has always to be in a range from 5 to 20. Correct if under minimum or above maximum.
    /// Every car brakes at most 10 km/h per second. (Very bad brakes, I know... This car would braking bad. :D)
    /// The maximum speed of a car is 250 km/h and of course it cannot have a negative speed.
    /// The consumption for a driving car is be taken from these ranges:
    /// 1 - 60 km/h -> 0.0020 liter/second
    /// 61 - 100 km/h -> 0.0014 liter/second
    /// 101 - 140 km/h -> 0.0020 liter/second
    /// 141 - 200 km/h -> 0.0025 liter/second
    /// 201 - 250 km/h -> 0.0030 liter/second
    /// (When the car brakes or freewheels with getting slower, there is no fuel consumption as in modern cars, when the car "powers" the engine.)
    /// For convenience the accelerations and brakings are always linear and consumption is only for the speed at the end of every second. No considering on higher consumption while accelerating within a second
    /// In all tests only the whole car will be tested. Feel free to write your own tests for the other classes.
